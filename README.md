Handy Jobs Hub

-The password to navigate to the admin registration page is '12345'.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for job seekers and employers to connect. It includes several key features to facilitate this interaction:

    Authentication: Users can securely log in and out of the system.
    Authorization: Role-based access control ensures that users and admins only have access to the features relevant to their role.
    User and admin Registration: New users and admins can create accounts to access the platform.
    Role Assignment: Different roles (e.g., user, admin) are assigned to users based on their privileges.
    Profile Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete their profiles.
    Feature 1: Job Posting: Employers can post job vacancies, while job seekers can upload their CVs. This feature distinguishes between the two user types, allowing job seekers to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their CVs and employers to CRUD their job vacancies, facilitating connections between them.
    Feature 2: ** Feedback and Evaluation System:** Users can provide feedback and evaluations for both employers and job seekers. Additionally, the contributor can edit or remove their feedback, while all users can view it, enhancing the platform's reliability and enabling well-informed decisions.
    Admin Controls: Administrators have control over the platform, including the ability to remove users.
