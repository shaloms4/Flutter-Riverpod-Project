# Handy Jobs Hub

This project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for job seekers and employers to connect. It includes several key features to facilitate this interaction:

## Features

- **Authentication:** Users can securely log in and out of the system.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control ensures that users and admins only have access to the features relevant to their role.
- **User and Admin Registration:** New users and admins can create accounts to access the platform.
- **Role Assignment:** Different roles (e.g., user, admin) are assigned to users based on their privileges.
- **Profile Management:** Users can create, read, update, and delete their profiles.
- **Job Posting:** 
  - Employers can post job vacancies.
  - Job seekers can upload their CVs.
  - This feature distinguishes between the two user types, allowing job seekers to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their CVs and employers to CRUD their job vacancies, facilitating connections between them.
- **Feedback and Evaluation System:**
  - Users can provide feedback and evaluations for both employers and job seekers.
  - Contributors can edit or remove their feedback, while all users can view it, enhancing the platform's reliability and enabling well-informed decisions.
- **Admin Controls:** Administrators have control over the platform, including the ability to remove users.
